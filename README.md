- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas Barbazuk (@tbarbazuk)
 
- I am currently a SEMM Doctoral student at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) and the University of Trento (UNITN), specializing in Computational Metagenomics. I am also a research collaborator with Reactome through the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR). Previously, I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in Medical Genomics at the University of Toronto and OICR.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about applying computational approaches to unravel complex biological systems, including my work on Reactome pathway curation and modeling, as well as investigating strain  
  transmission dynamics in microbial communities with the Segata Lab.  

- Outside of science, I am an interdisciplinary, competitive cyclist with over a decade of experience racing between the tape.
